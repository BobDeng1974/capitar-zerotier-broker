= RPC PROTOCOL

This protocol is used by the proxy to talk to individual workers.

== Operational Overview

The RPC protocol implemented using the NNG REQ/REP pattern.

The proxy opens a REQ socket and dials to a the worker's REP socket.
(Address discovery is handled in the SURVEY protocol, documented
elsewhere.)

The entire protocol uses the ZeroTier network, and specifically the
NNG ZeroTier transport, exclusively.

The protocol is a flavor (or perhaps subset) of JSON-RPC v2.0.
We only support normal single issue requests (no batching, and no
notifications.)  Furthermore, we only support "id" attributes that
are 64-bit non-zero values encoded as hexadecimal strings.
(E.g. "fff").  (We might want to investigate relaxing this later, but
as we control both sides of the protocol it seems reasonable for now.)
Requests always contain a "params" object, which is always an object (i.e.
we do not support positional parameters.)

We also play a little fast and loose with the protocol, where we cannot
decode the incoming request properly (or it fails to meet our above
limitations) may come back with a generic error object, and with
a zero ID attribute.  This only happens if the client sends a bad
request to the server, so it's entirely avoidable.  (Again we control
both sides.)

Request IDs are used to provide a level of idempotency for requests
that need it, such as blind create requests.  This prevents us from
creating mutiple objects when a create request is replayed due to a lost
packet, for example.

For responses, the proxy converts the "code" of any error object to the HTTP
status, and treats "message" as the status line.  If the code is outside
range of legal HTTP status codes (100 through 599) then we convert it to a
generic 500.

For a successful response, the proxy assumes HTTP status 200.  (We may want to
change this to do a 201 or a 204 in some cases.)

== Method Definitions

The following individual methods are defined.
Note that in each section below, the "`Method`" is the `method` object of the
request, the "`Parameters`" are the `params` object, and the "`Result`" will
be the `result` object of a successful operation.

=== Controller Status

This obtains the status of the named controller (or central).

Method:: `status`

Parameters::
	`controller`:::  Controller ID (hexstring, 40-bit).

Result::
Object, with status from the server.

	`version`:::
	API version, "1.0" for now.
	Version numbers are strings, in "major.minor" form.
	These use semantic versioning, so the major number will be incremented
	when there are breaking changes to the API (with minor reset to zero),
	and the minor number is incremented when there are API changes that are
	non-breaking to older clients.
	`controller`:::
	true if the server is for a controller (bool)
	`central`:::
	true if the server is for central API server (bool)

=== Network List

This obtains the list of networks from the controller.

Method:: `get-networks`

Parameters::
	`controller`:::  Controller ID (hexstring, 40-bit).

Result::
	Array of networks serviced by controller, each element is
	a hexstring of the network ID.

=== Get Network Object

This obtains the details of a given network from the controller.

Method:: `get-network`

Parameters::
	`controller`:::
		Controller ID (hexstring, 40-bit).
	`network`:::
		Network ID (hexstring, 64-bit).

Result::
	`id`::: The network ID (hexstring, 40-bit).
	`name`::: The network name (string).
	`private`::: True if the network is private (bool).
	`creationTime`::: Integer (msec since epoch) when network was created.
	`multicastLimit`::: Integer, limit on number of nodes to receive a multicast.
	`enableBroadcast`::: Boolean, true if broadcast is enabled.
	`v4AssignMode`::: Object, with booleans for IPv4 assignment modes.
	`v6AssignMode`::: Object, with booleans for IPv6 assignment modes.
	`routes`::: Array of IP routes to network members.

=== Get Network Members

This obtains an array of members of the network.

Method:: `get-network-members`

Parameters::
	`controller`:::
		Controller ID (hexstring, 40-bit).
	`network`:::
		Network ID (hexstring, 64-bit).

Result::
	Aray of strings, each of which is a 10-digit hexadecimal
	node id, each of which is a member of the network.

=== Get Network Member

This obtains a single network member.

Method:: `get-network-member`

Parameters::
	`controller`:::
		Controller ID (hexstring, 40-bit).
	`network`:::
		Network ID (hexstring, 64-bit).
	`member`:::
		Member node ID (hexstring, 40-bit).

Result::
	`id`::: The node ID, 16-digit hexadecimal (string).
	`nwid`::: The network ID, 10-digit hexidecimal (string).
	`authorized`::: true if the member is authorized (bool).
	`activeBridge`::: true if the member may bridge packets (bool).
	`revision`::: Member revision counter.
	`ipAssignments`::: Array of managed IP address assignments (strings).

=== Delete Network Member

This deletes a single network member.

Method:: `delete-network-member`

Parameters::
	`controller`:::
		Controller ID (hexstring, 40-bit).
	`network`:::
		Network ID (hexstring, 64-bit).
	`member`:::
		Member node ID (hexstring, 40-bit).

Result::
	Empty object.
