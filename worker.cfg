	# URL to use to register with (the value established by the proxy),
	# and the "reqrep" value is the local server address on the same
	# network.  The * character can be used for the nodeid and port
	# number in the reqrep piece, in which case the local node id and
	# an ephemeral port will be used.

	# networks, if defined, is an array of network IDs to expose or hide.
	# Each element is a string, prefixed by either "+" or "-".  A "+"
	# means that the network will be shown, and a - means that the network
	# will not be shown.  If no prefix is given, it means "+".  The
	# network will be matched against every element until a match is found.
	# If this element is empty, or missing, then a default of +all is
	# assumed.  If no match is found, then the default permission is deny.
	# Note that unless a +all entry is present, creating new
	# networks will not be permitted.
	# Example: To deny all nodes except one: [ "1234567890abcdef" ] or
	# [ "1234567890abcdef", "-all" ]
	# To deny deny *only* one node: [ "+all", "-1234567890abcdef" ]
