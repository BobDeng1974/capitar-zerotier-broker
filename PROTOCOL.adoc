There are four separate protocols used in this project.

1. Protocol exposed by the controller nodes.  This is a REST API
	 exposed typically to localhost:9993, and is controlled by ZeroTier.
	 We have configuration objects to help select this API.  Workers use
	 this protocol to talk to the controller.  This is not discussed further
	 here.

2. RPC protocol between the proxy and the worker.  See
   <<RPC.adoc#>> for details.

3. Survey  used so that workers can register with proxy.
   See <<SURVEY.adoc#>> for details.

4. REST API exposed by the proxy.
   See <<REST.adoc#>> for details.

Operationally, the only public facing thing is the REST API, which is provided
by the proxy.

The workers register with the proxy using the survey protocol.  The proxy is
then able to direct requests (after translating them from REST) to the
workers over the RPC protocol.

The connection between the workers and the controller is over loopback,
or possibly a TLS protected network.

The connection between the workers and the proxy is over the NNG ZeroTier
transport (so both the workers and the proxy must be on the same network.)

Note that a single proxy can have multiple workers, and that a single worker
can provide service to multiple proxies.
