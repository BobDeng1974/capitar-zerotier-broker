	# Valid values:
	#
	# survey: (string) NNG URI for surveyor (where workers will connect)
	# http: (string) URL where the server will listen, may be http or https
	# zthome: (string, optional) pathname to store ZeroTier configuration

	# TLS Configuration. This is required if serving an HTTPs URL.
	#
	# Parameters are:
	# keyfile: (string) filename where the key is stored.
	# keypass: (string) password for encrypted key
	# server: (string) server name for SNI, used to match cert on client

	# A note when using encrypted key files; the encryption used must
	# be supported by the TLS code.  By default, x509 will use DES
	# keys, which are not supported in some configurations.  Consider
	# using AES128-CBC to encrypt your RSA private keys.
