	# This file is JSON, but also supports shell style comments, on

	#
	# survey: (string) NNG URI for surveyor (where workers will connect)
	# http: (string) URL where the server will listen, may be http or https
	# zthome: (string, optional) pathname to store ZeroTier configuration

	# The site is always served from the /static URI (this is built

	# TLS Configuration. This is required if serving an HTTPs URL.
	#
	# Parameters are:

	# using AES128-CBC to encrypt your RSA private keys.
