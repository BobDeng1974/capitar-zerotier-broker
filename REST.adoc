= REST API

This protocol is offered by the proxy, and is how clients connect to
perform operations.

All operations are prefixed with a "`base URL`", which will be the hostname
and port (e.g. `http://example.com:9994`) followed by a standard URI prefix,
which is `/api/1.0/`.
All REST endpoints under this are assumed to conform to the API documented here.

All content exchanged over this protocol is in the form of JSON objects.

== Authentication

Authentication for controllers is unique to each controller, with
realm names based on the supplied controller name.
Hence, the `realm` returned in a `WWW-Authenticate:` response
401 header will be different depending which controller is being
addressed.

=== Basic Authentication

Normal HTTP Basic Authentication can be used, unless the user
has a two-factor device (one-time-password generator) configured.

=== Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication is based on OAth TOTP (see RFC 4622)
and works just like HTTP Basic Authentication, except that an additional header,
`X-ZTC-OTP` must be supplied.  This header
must contain the value of a one-time-password (typically a 6, 7, 8,
or 9 digit number) generated from the second factor.
The `Authorization:` header must still contain the user's Basic
authentication.

=== API Token Authentication

API tokens can be created (see API below) and used.  These may be
supplied as either "`Bearer`" tokens using the Bearer form of
`Authorization:` header, or they may be supplied in a seperate
`X-ZTC-Token:` header.

== API Endpoints

The following individual API endpoints and methods are defined.  We have
elided the `/api/1.0` prefix in the documentation below, but each URI
must include that prefix.


=== Controller Status

This obtains the status of the named controller (or central).

URI:: `/proxy/$controller/status`

Method:: `GET`

URI Parameters::
	`$controller`::: This is the name (or label) of the controller to query.
Body Parameters::
	None.

Result::
Object, with status from the server.

	`version`:::
	API version, "1.0" for now.
	Version numbers are strings, in "major.minor" form.
	These use semantic versioning, so the major number will be incremented
	when there are breaking changes to the API (with minor reset to zero),
	and the minor number is incremented when there are API changes that are
	non-breaking to older clients.
	`controller`:::
	true if the server is for a controller (bool)

	true if the server is for central API server (bool)
