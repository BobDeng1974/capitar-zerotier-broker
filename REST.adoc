= REST API

This protocol is offered by the proxy, and is how clients connect to
perform operations.

All operations are prefixed with a "`base URL`", which will be the hostname
and port (e.g. `http://example.com:9994`) followed by a standard URI prefix,
which is `/api/1.0/`.
All REST endpoints under this are assumed to conform to the API documented here.

All content exchanged over this protocol is in the form of JSON objects.

== API Endpoints

The following individual API endpoints and methods are defined.  We have
elided the `/api/1.0` prefix in the documentation below, but each URI
must include that prefix.

=== Controller Status

This obtains the status of the named controller (or central).

URI:: `/proxy/$controller/status`

Method:: `GET`

URI Parameters::
	`$controller`::: This is the name (or label) of the controller to query.
Body Parameters::
	None.

Result::
Object, with status from the server.

	`version`:::
	API version, "1.0" for now.
	Version numbers are strings, in "major.minor" form.
	These use semantic versioning, so the major number will be incremented
	when there are breaking changes to the API (with minor reset to zero),
	and the minor number is incremented when there are API changes that are
	non-breaking to older clients.
	`controller`:::
	true if the server is for a controller (bool)
	`central`:::
	true if the server is for central API server (bool)

=== Network List

This obtains the list of networks from the controller.

URI:: `/proxy/$controller/network`

Method:: `GET`

URI Parameters::
	`$controller`::: This is the name (or label) of of the controller to query.

Body Parameters::
	None.

Result::
	Array of networks serviced by controller, each element is
	a 16-digit hexadecimal string representing the network ID.

=== Get Network Object

This obtains the details of a given network from the controller.

URI:: `/proxy/$controller/network/$nwid`

Method:: `GET`

URI Parameters::
	`$controller`::: This is the name (or label) of the controller to query.
	`$nwid`::: This is the network ID, as a 16-digit decimal string.

Body Parameters::
	None.

Result::

	`id`::: The network ID (hexstring, 40-bit).
	`name`::: The network name (string).
	`private`::: Boolean, true if the network is private.
	`creationTime`::: Integer (msec since epoch) when network was created.
	`multicastLimit`::: Integer, limit on number of nodes to receive a multicast.
	`enableBroadcast`::: Boolean, true if broadcast is enabled.
	`v4AssignMode`::: Object, with booleans for IPv4 assignment modes.
	`v6AssignMode`::: Object, with booleans for IPv6 assignment modes.
	`routes`::: Array of IP routes to network members.

=== Get Network Member

This obtains details of a specific network member.

URI:: `/proxy/$controller/network/$nwid/member/$nodeid`

Method:: `GET`

URI Parameters::
	`$controller`::: This is name (or label) of the controller to query.
	`$nwid`::: This is the network ID, as a 16-digit decimal string.
	`$nodied`::: This is the node ID of the member, as a 10-digit decimal string.

Body Parameters::
	None.

Result::
	`id`::: The node ID, 16-digit hexadecimal (string).
	`nwid`::: The network ID, 10-digit hexidecimal (string).
	`authorized`::: true if the member is authorized (bool).
	`activeBridge`::: true if the member may bridge packets (bool).
	`revision`::: Member revision counter.
	`ipAssignments`::: Array of managed IP address assignments (strings).

=== Delete Network Member

This deletes a network member.

URI:: `/proxy/$controller/network/$nwid/member/$nodeid`

Method:: `DELETE`

URI Parameters::
	`$controller`::: This is the name (or label) of the controller to access.
	`$nwid`::: This is the network ID, as a 16-digit decimal string.
	`$nodied`::: This is the node ID of the member, as a 10-digit decimal string.

Body Parameters::
	None.

Result::
	Empty object.  (Perhaps instead a 204 No Content response?)
